Feature extraction: analyze the relations between different things
however, we must convert the audio into a format that the machine can understand
audio signal is a three-dimensional signal in which three axes represent time, amplitude and frequency.
Features:
1) Zero Crossing Rate : The rate of sign-changes of the signal during the duration of a particular frame.
    - used to discern between voiced (e.g. vowels) and unvoiced (e.g. consonants) sounds
    - voiced sounds have low zcr b/c they are more periodic; unvoiced sounds have high zcr b/c they have more noise-like characteristics
2) Energy : The sum of squares of the signal values, normalized by the respective frame length.
3) Entropy of Energy : The entropy of sub-framesâ€™ normalized energies. It can be interpreted as a measure of abrupt changes.
4) Spectral Centroid : The center of gravity of the spectrum.
5) Spectral Spread : The second central moment of the spectrum.
6) Spectral Entropy : Entropy of the normalized spectral energies for a set of sub-frames.
7) Spectral Flux : The squared difference between the normalized magnitudes of the spectra of the two successive frames.
8) Spectral Rolloff : The frequency below which 90% of the magnitude distribution of the spectrum is concentrated.
9) MFCCs Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients form a cepstral representation where the frequency bands are not linear but distributed according to the mel-scale.
10) Chroma Vector : A 12-element representation of the spectral energy where the bins represent the 12 equal-tempered pitch classes of western-type music (semitone spacing).
11) Chroma Deviation : The standard deviation of the 12 chroma coefficients.
12) Chroma STFT : captures the harmonic content of an audio signal
    - maps the energy of frequencies to their respective pitch classes, regardless of the octave.
    - focuses on harmonic structure rather than the full spectrum of frequencies.
13) Root Mean Square Value : measure of energy or loudness of an audio signal
    - provides a scalar value representing the signal's average amplitude over time
